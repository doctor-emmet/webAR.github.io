  		<div class="cItem">“I have been in the very fortunate position to have been aware of the work of Rita Treacy over a considerable number of years.  I have seen the WordsWorthLearning Programme develop from her early work into what is now a robust, systematic and evaluated intervention strategy for individuals with a Specific Learning Difficulty (Dyslexia).  I have referred many individuals for intervention in the past, and continue to do so, having received very positive feedback from clients and their families. This Programme has proven effective in helping to remediate both reading and written language difficulties, and, of importance, on repeat testing I have found measurable increases in reading and written language literacy levels following intervention. I would highly recommend this innovative Programme of intervention.”  <b>Fíona Kelly Meldon, Consulting Clinical and Educational Psychologist, Dublin, Ireland.</b></div>

  		<div class="cItem">“I have worked as an Educational Psychologist for nearly 20 years. Rita's WordsWorthLearning programme has consistently been a go-to recommendation in my reports. The programme is suitable for all ages and abilities. My clients have returned with significantly better results than would otherwise be expected having completed the programme. Rita has evolved the programme into something that is accessible from home, practical and engaging. I have regularly recommended it to School Principal's and Learning Support teachers. Wishing Rita and the WordsWorthLearning programme continued success”. <b> Deirdre Griffin, Consulting Educational Psychologist, Dublin, Ireland. </b></div>

  		<div class="cItem">“Caint Speech Therapy has used WordsWorthLearning with many of our clients, in private practice and in schools, who present with literacy difficulties. It provides a structured format that allows clients to build vital sound processing foundations for literacy. WordsWorthLearning progresses through a systematic hierarchy and builds on student skills in a systematic way. Older students can work through each level of the programme independently as it gives feedback and answers to each task.  WordsWorthLearning is one of the only programmes that focuses on reading and spelling at the same time. I would recommend this programme for students who have reading and spelling difficulties”. <b>Catherine Sheahan, Clinic Director, Caint Speech Therapy, Ireland.</b></div>
  		<div class="cItem">“I have found the WordsWorthLearning reading programme to be an excellent tool in literacy intervention. The programme was particularly useful in breaking down the core phonic skills and rules required for word attack and building them up systematically to bring about an improvement in reading fluency.The programme also allowed for all important parent involvement with supervised home practice, which accelerated progress. WordsWorthLearning principles could be easily generalized to reading materials for school and leisure. Once fluency had improved through WordsWorthLearning intervention, comprehension strategies could be effectively applied which brought about significant improvement in comprehension of reading material”. <b>Celine Lenihan, Consulting Speech & Language Therapist, Ireland.</b>
  </div>
  		<div class="cItem">“As an OT many children are referred to me with problems regarding their handwriting. Following my assessment, in some cases, it is evident that rather than one of praxis or motor control, it is the child's phonological and literacy skills that are contributing to their handwriting difficulties. I am delighted that I can work closely with Rita and her wonderful WordsWorthLearning programme to ensure that, with both of our skillsets, children's needs are accurately identified and intervention can be tailored to suit their specific difficulties so that they can reach their potential. Rita is a highly experienced and passionate therapist whose knowledge of speech and language, combined with literacy, make her a unique and powerful addition to any team. Any parents whom I have worked with cannot speak highly enough of both Rita and the WordsWorthLearning programme!”.  <b>Emma Butler, Senior Paediatric Occupational Therapist, MAOTI, Dublin, Ireland.</b>
  </div>
  		<div class="cItem">“I first heard about the WordsWorth Programme about eight years ago from a parent of a child in the school. This parent’s child was not progressing according to her ability and as a result was lacking confidence. The WordsWorth programme was recommended following an assessment by an educational Psychologist. This child attended sessions with Rita Treacy and did follow up work at home. The WordsWorth Programme was immensely helpful and successful. It complimented other programmes being done in class. Since then the WordsWorth Programme has been recommended by psychologists for many children.  These children’s reading, comprehension and spelling have improved greatly as a result of following the WordsWorth Programme. Several teachers in this school are very impressed by the progress children make while following WordsWorth programme. Many teachers have attended the one day training course. One teacher piloted WordsWorth with a senior class last year.   Teachers in this school have now asked Rita Treacy to work with us to develop a whole school programme suitable for mainstream classes. We hope to pilot this programme in mainstream classes from Jan 2016”. <b>Sr. Kathleen Lyng (Principal) St Brigid’s N.S., Greystones, Ireland.</b>
  </div>

  		<div class="cItem">“St Anne's N.S. has made use of the WordsWorthLearning Resource for a number of years now. We quickly saw how the online lessons were of great benefit to individual children with dyslexia and WordsWorthLearning has become one of the key elements in our Learning Support department. We have also put WordsWorthLearning to work in a class setting. One of our Third Class teachers tested its effectiveness using the Schonell Test. Over a six-month period, the pupils' attainment in spelling increased dramatically with some children's spelling age being raised by over two years.We will continue to use WordsWorthLearning in both Learning Support and mainstream classes”. <b> Jim Halligan (Principal), St Annes N.S., Shankhill, Dublin, Ireland.</b>
  </div>
  		<div class="cItem">“I came across the Wordsworth Programme when I worked as a Learning Support and Resource Teacher.  The children who worked consistently on the programme at home made great progress in literacy. At this stage it was a paper based programme. I am now teaching a class and one of my pupils completed the online programme last year.  He too improved enormously. In all cases the children’s comprehension improved when their reading improved. I had the opportunity last year to do a day’s training with Rita Treacy. The programme is rules based which helps the children make more sense of the English language.  The programme shows them a way to learn spellings which also works for many of them. The programme itself is very easy to use, it is clear and the children can use it without any help. I think that as the children experience success relatively quickly, it gives the motivation to continue working on the programme. I hope to do the complete programme with my class this year.  I found that the rules can in many cases help answer the question as to how a word is spelt in a certain way”.  <b>Sile Hennigan, 5th Class Teacher, St Brigid's N.S., Greystones, Ireland.</b>
